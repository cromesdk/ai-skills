  short_description: "Deterministic multi-assistant @spec-kit/cli stage-gated workflow with artifact checks, rollback routing, and command normalization"
  default_prompt: "Use $spec-kit-workflow to enforce real spec-kit execution end-to-end across Copilot/Codex/Cursor/Claude environments: verify spec-kit-setup readiness and required artifacts, verify npm-based CLI readiness for @spec-kit/cli, resolve CLI invocation (`specify` or fallback `npx @spec-kit/cli@latest`), normalize /speckit.* requests to native /constitution /specify /plan /tasks commands, run the corresponding CLI commands for real, and never simulate stage completion. Block or roll back when prerequisites or generated artifacts are missing, require explicit feature text for /specify <text>, preserve user-provided assistant in remediation commands, run /plan with only relevant installed skills, generate ordered /tasks with verification checkpoints, and always return execution log plus artifact verification with exact next command."
