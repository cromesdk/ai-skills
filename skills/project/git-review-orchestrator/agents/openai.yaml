  default_prompt: "Run a deterministic Plan-Mode-only git review pipeline: preflight checks first, then review, tests, formatter/linter, and docs/version planning with fail-fast gate behavior, relevant-skill routing by changed files, mandatory README evaluation in Gate D, explicit gate matrix output, and no automatic git commit."
