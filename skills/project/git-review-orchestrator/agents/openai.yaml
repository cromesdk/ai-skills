  default_prompt: "Run a deterministic git review pipeline: preflight checks first, then review, tests, formatter/linter, and docs/version execution with fail-fast gate behavior, relevant-skill routing by changed files, mandatory README and CHANGELOG file updates in Gate D for non-empty scope, explicit gate matrix output, and no automatic git commit."
